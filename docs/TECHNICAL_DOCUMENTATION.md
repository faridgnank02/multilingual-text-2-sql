## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Multilingual Text-to-SQL Generator is an AI-powered system that automatically converts natural language questions into executable SQL queries across multiple languages. The system tackles the challenge of making database querying accessible to non-technical users while maintaining security and accuracy.

This project addresses the problem of language barriers in database access by enabling users to query databases in their native language. It's particularly useful for business intelligence, data analysis, and educational contexts where SQL expertise is limited but data insights are essential.


### 1.2 Core Functionality

The system handles multiple input languages and automatically translates them to English for optimal SQL generation. It uses a sophisticated workflow orchestrated by LangGraph that combines multiple AI components:

- **LangGraph Workflow Engine**: State-managed processing pipeline with conditional transitions and error recovery
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Integration**: Cloud-based language model for translation and SQL generation
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Semantic search system for SQL documentation and examples
- **Dynamic Database Management**: Support for multiple SQLite databases with automatic schema detection

The system automatically selects the optimal processing path based on input characteristics, database schema complexity, and available resources.

```python
class WorkflowManager:
    def process_query(self, request: QueryRequest)
    def select_optimal_path(self, input_characteristics)
    def handle_error_recovery(self, error_context)
```

### 1.3 Technical Architecture

The project implements a modular microservices-inspired architecture where each component handles a specific aspect of the text-to-SQL conversion process. The main components include workflow orchestration, language processing, database management, vector search, and model lifecycle management.

Users can interact with the system through both a web interface built with Flask and a command-line interface for developers. The Flask interface uses form-based interactions rather than REST API endpoints.

```python
# Main application structure

├── workflow.py         # LangGraph orchestration
├── sql_generation.py   # SQL generation logic
├── vector_store.py     # FAISS vector search
├── database.py         # Database management
├── sql_model.py        # MLflow model wrapper
└── definitions.py      # Configuration constants

main.py                # CLI interface
register_model.py      # MLflow model registration
```

### 1.4 Key Features

The system includes comprehensive quality assurance with multi-layer security validation, automatic error recovery, and detailed query explanations. SQL injection protection uses pattern matching and query analysis to prevent malicious inputs.

Real-time monitoring tracks system performance, user interactions, and model effectiveness through MLflow integration. The quality assessment system provides confidence scores and detailed explanations for generated queries.

The system is optimized for production deployment with Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

### 1.5 Startup Sequence

The application requires a specific initialization order for proper functionality:

1. **Database Initialization**: `src/database.py` - Sets up SQLite database with default tables
2. **Vector Store Preparation**: `src/vector_store.py` - Loads or creates FAISS vector store
3. **Model Registration**: `register_model.py` - **MANDATORY** - Registers the LangGraph workflow in MLflow
4. **Application Launch**: `app.py` or `main.py` - Starts the web or CLI interface

This sequence ensures all dependencies are properly initialized before the main application starts.

## 2. Data Processing and Workflow Pipeline

### 2.1 Multi-Language Input Processing

The system handles diverse input sources with automatic language detection and normalization. The input processing pipeline validates user queries, detects language, and prepares content for the workflow engine.

```python
class InputProcessor:
    def validate_input(self, user_query: str)
    def detect_language(self, text: str)
    def normalize_input(self, text: str)
```

Input validation includes checks for malicious patterns, excessive length, and content quality assessment. The system supports unlimited languages through GPT-4o-mini's multilingual capabilities while optimizing for French and English processing.

Language detection uses OpenAI's language understanding to identify the input language automatically. If detection fails or confidence is low, the system defaults to English processing with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

### 2.2 LangGraph Workflow Architecture

The core processing engine implements a sophisticated state machine using LangGraph. The workflow consists of **nine sequential nodes** with conditional transitions based on processing outcomes:

1. **translate_input** - Translates user input to English
2. **pre_safety_check** - Validates input for malicious patterns
3. **schema_extract** - Extracts database schema
4. **context_check** - Verifies query relevance to schema
5. **generate** - Generates SQL using RAG
6. **post_safety_check** - Validates generated SQL
7. **sql_check** - Tests SQL syntax with SAVEPOINT
8. **run_query** - Executes the validated query
9. **translate_answer** - Translates response to original language

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    error: str
    messages: List
    generation: Optional[dict]
    # ... autres champs d'état

def get_workflow(conn, cursor, vector_store):
    """Define and compile the LangGraph workflow."""
```

The workflow maintains state across all processing steps, enabling sophisticated error recovery and context preservation. Each node can trigger transitions to other nodes based on validation results, errors, or quality assessments.

### 2.3 Database Schema Extraction and Context Building

The schema extraction system automatically analyzes the active database structure to provide context for SQL generation. It queries SQLite metadata tables to build comprehensive schema representations.

```python
def schema_extract(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Extract database schema (tables and columns)."""
    # Extracts table names and column definitions from SQLite metadata
```

The schema extraction includes table names, column definitions, data types, constraints, and relationships. This contextual information is crucial for accurate SQL generation and helps the model understand the database structure.

### 2.4 Vector-Based Knowledge Retrieval

The system implements a FAISS-based vector store for semantic search across SQL documentation. This creates a specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for SQL query examples and best practices.

```python
def setup_vector_store(logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None):
    """Setup or load the vector store (FAISS)."""
    # Loads existing FAISS store or creates from W3Schools SQL docs
```

The vector store indexes SQL documentation from W3Schools with intelligent chunking strategies. Documents are split into 500-character chunks with 50-character overlap to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient retrieval.

### 2.5 Performance Optimization

The system implements performance optimizations at the processing and resource management levels. Optimizations include database connection reuse and efficient memory management.

```python
# Connection optimization and resource management
conn, cursor, vector_store = setup_components()
app_workflow = model.predict(model_input)

def process_uploaded_file(file, db_name, table_name=None):
    # File processing with automatic cleanup
```

Optimizations include efficient memory management, automatic cleanup of temporary files, and reuse of loaded models to avoid costly reloads.

## 3. AI Models and Implementation

### 3.1 LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

The core AI processing engine uses LangGraph to implement a sophisticated state machine that handles the complete text-to-SQL conversion pipeline. The workflow manages **nine distinct processing stages** with intelligent transitions and error recovery.

```python
def get_workflow(conn, cursor, vector_store):
    """Define and compile the LangGraph workflow."""
    # Creates 9-node workflow with error recovery
    def translate_input(state: GraphState) -> GraphState: ...
    def pre_safety_check(state: GraphState) -> GraphState: ...
    # ...
    
    return StateGraph(GraphState).compile()
```

The workflow implements conditional routing where each node can transition to other nodes based on processing outcomes. This creates a robust system that can handle errors, retry failed operations, and adapt to different content types dynamically.

### 3.2 Translation and Language Processing

The translation system normalizes multilingual input to English for optimal SQL generation. It uses GPT-4o-mini with specialized prompts that preserve technical terminology and database-specific vocabulary.

```python
def translate_input(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Translate user input to English or preserve if already English."""
```

The translation system includes intelligent detection mechanisms that avoid unnecessary translation of English content while ensuring accurate conversion of technical database terminology across languages.

### 3.3 SQL Generation with Context Integration

The SQL generation engine combines multiple context sources to create accurate, executable queries. It integrates database schema, retrieved documentation, and user intent into a comprehensive prompt structure.

```python
class SQLQuery(BaseModel):
    description: str
    sql_code: str

def get_sql_gen_chain():
    # Returns LangChain chain for SQL generation
```

The generation process first performs semantic search in the FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant SQL documentation and examples. These examples provide context that helps the model understand best practices and appropriate SQL patterns.

### 3.4 Security Validation and Injection Prevention

The system implements multi-layer security validation to prevent SQL injection attacks and unauthorized database operations. Security is handled at two points in the workflow:

```python
def pre_safety_check(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Validates input for malicious SQL operations."""
    # Checks for CREATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.

def post_safety_check(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Validates generated SQL for security."""
    # Double-checks generated SQL for forbidden operations
```

When security violations are detected, the workflow either terminates (for input violations) or retries generation (for output violations) with error context.

### 3.5 Query Execution and Result Processing

The execution engine runs validated SQL queries against the active database and formats results for user consumption. The execution is handled in the `run_query` node:

```python
def run_query(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Execute validated SQL and format results."""
    # Executes SQL, handles SELECT vs non-SELECT, formats output
```

The execution system includes comprehensive error handling and automatic result formatting based on query type and result size.

## 4. System Architecture and Components

### 4.1 Web Interface (Flask)

The primary user interface is built with Flask, providing an intuitive web application for multilingual SQL query generation. The interface handles multiple input types and provides real-time feedback during processing.

```python
@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    # Handles query processing and file uploads
```

The interface includes progress indicators, real-time validation, and comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages. It also provides database switching capabilities and file upload functionality.

### 4.2 Database Management System

The system implements dynamic database management supporting multiple SQLite databases with automatic switching and metadata extraction.

```python
def list_databases() -> Dict:
def import_csv_to_database(csv_path: str, db_name: str) -> Dict:
def import_sql_to_database(sql_path: str, db_name: str) -> Dict:
def set_active_database(db_key: str) -> Dict:
def get_active_database() -> str:
```

The database manager supports importing CSV files with automatic type inference, SQL files with full script execution, and existing SQLite databases with validation and metadata extraction.

### 4.3 Flask Web Interface

The system uses Flask to provide a web-based interface for SQL generation. The current implementation focuses on form-based interactions rather than REST API endpoints.


The Flask interface handles file uploads, query processing, and database management through form submissions with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

### 4.4 Command Line Interface

The system provides two CLI interfaces: `main.py` for interactive SQL queries and `database_manager.py` for database management.

The CLI interfaces provide MLflow experiment tracking, detailed logging, and comprehensive database management capabilities.

## 5. Model Lifecycle Management with MLflow

### 5.1 Model Registration and Versioning

The system leverages MLflow for comprehensive model lifecycle management, from development through production deployment. The architecture encapsulates the entire LangGraph workflow as a deployable model artifact.

```python
class SQLGenerator(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):
    def predict(self, context: Any, model_input: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Any:
        """Returns a compiled LangGraph workflow."""

# Model registration from register_model.py
with mlflow.start_run():
    input_example = {"conn": None, "cursor": None, "vector_store": None}
    logged_model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
        name="sql_generator",
        python_model=SQLGenerator(),
        input_example=input_example,
    )

# Register and set alias
registered_mv = mlflow.register_model(logged_model_info.model_uri, REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME)
client.set_registered_model_alias(REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME, MODEL_ALIAS, registered_mv.version)
```

The registration system captures the complete workflow as a versioned artifact, including all dependencies, configurations, and code. This enables reproducible deployments and easy rollback capabilities.

### 5.2 Experiment Tracking and Performance Monitoring

MLflow automatically tracks experiments and performance metrics through LangChain integration and custom logging systems.

```python
# MLflow configuration in main.py
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(REMOTE_SERVER_URI)
mlflow.set_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)
mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# Performance tracking per query
with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"sql_generation_run_{run_idx}"):
    mlflow.log_param("question", question)
    mlflow.log_param("database_tables", str([t[0] for t in tables]))
    
    start_time = time.time()
    solution = app.invoke(initial_state)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    mlflow.log_metric("duration_seconds", duration)
    mlflow.log_param("sql_query", sql_query or "(No SQL returned)")
    mlflow.log_param("translated_input", translated_input)
```

### 5.3 Model Deployment and Loading

The production system includes sophisticated model loading with fallback mechanisms and health monitoring.

```python
class ModelManager:
    def __init__(self)
    def load_production_model(self, model_name: str, alias: str = "Production") -> bool
    def _verify_model_health(self) -> bool
    def get_model_info(self) -> Dict
```


### 5.4 Deployment Strategy

The system uses MLflow aliases for production model version management.

```python
# Model registration in register_model.py
with mlflow.start_run():
    logged_model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
        name="sql_generator",
        python_model=SQLGenerator(),
        input_example=input_example,
    )

# Registration with alias
registered_mv = mlflow.register_model(logged_model_info.model_uri, REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME)
client.set_registered_model_alias(
    REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME,
    MODEL_ALIAS,
    registered_mv.version
)

# Production model loading
model_uri = f"models:/{REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME}@{MODEL_ALIAS}"
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)
```

This strategy enables secure model updates with version management and rollback capability via MLflow aliases.

## 6. Deployment Strategies and Production Architecture

### 6.1 Containerized Deployment with Docker

The system implements a comprehensive containerization strategy optimized for production environments. The Docker architecture supports both single-container deployments and orchestrated multi-service configurations.

    mlflow.log_param("sql_query", sql_query or "(No SQL returned)")
    if translated_input:
        mlflow.log_param("translated_input", translated_input)
```



### 6.5 Performance Optimization and Scaling

The system includes basic optimization mechanisms for production environments. Performance optimization relies on Flask configuration and deployment best practices.

```python
# Flask production configuration
app = Flask(__name__)
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB max
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'csv', 'sql', 'db', 'sqlite', 'sqlite3'}

cd multilingual-text-2-sql
```

### 8.2 Quick Installation and Setup

> **Note:** For complete startup instructions, see [STARTUP_GUIDE.md](STARTUP_GUIDE.md)

The project includes automated installation scripts for rapid deployment:

```bash
# Setup environment and dependencies
python3 -m venv multilingual-sql-env
source multilingual-sql-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure and launch
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python register_model.py
mlflow ui &
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5001` with MLflow monitoring at `http://localhost:5000`.

**Note**: The Flask app runs on port 5001 (as defined in `app.py`) while MLflow UI runs on the default port 5000.

### 8.3 Testing Core Functionality

**Web Interface Testing:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`
2. Test multilingual input with questions appropriate to the active database:
   - For Netflix database: "Quel titre a le nom le plus long ?" (French)
   - For Netflix database: "How many titles were watched in 2021?" (English)
   - For other databases: Switch database first using database manager
3. Upload custom databases using the drag-and-drop interface
4. Switch between different databases and verify schema detection

**Form-based Testing:**
```bash
# Query testing (adapted to current Netflix database)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/ -F "action=question" -F "question=What titles were watched?"

# File upload testing  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/ -F "action=upload" -F "db_file=@examples/employes.csv"
```

**CLI Testing:**
```bash
# Launch interactive CLI
python main.py

# Enter test queries appropriate to active database
> What Netflix titles have the longest names?
> Combien de titres ont été regardés ?
> quit
```

### 8.4 Active Database Management

**Current Active Database:**
The system currently uses "Netflix history" database with NetflixViewingHistory table (1,193 records).

```bash
# Check current active database
python database_manager.py list

# Switch to different database (example: school database)
python database_manager.py set-active --db-key ecole

# Verify database switch
python database_manager.py list
```

**Important:** Questions must match the active database schema. For Netflix database, ask about titles and dates, not customers or orders.

### 8.5 Database Import Testing

Test the multi-format database import capabilities:

**CSV Import:**
```python
# Test CSV to SQLite conversion via web interface
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5001/upload', files={'file': csv_file})
```

**SQL Script Import:**
```bash
python database_manager.py import-sql --file examples/bibliotheque.sql --name library_db
python database_manager.py set-active --db-key library_db
```

### 8.6 Troubleshooting and Common Issues

**Model Loading Issues:**
- Register MLflow model first: `python3 register_model.py`
- Verify model registration is successful
- Check MLflow experiments in the web UI (optional): `mlflow ui`

**API Configuration:**
- Validate OpenAI API key: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Test API connectivity: `python -c "import openai; print('API key valid')"`
- Check rate limits and quotas

**Database Issues:**
- Verify database files exist in `data/databases/`
- Check active database: `python database_manager.py list`
- Validate database schema: `python database_manager.py info <db_name>`

**Context Check Issues:**
- If questions are rejected as "not related to database", verify question matches active database schema
- Netflix database only has Title and Date columns - ask about titles, not customers/orders
- Switch database if needed: `python database_manager.py set-active --db-key <database_name>`

**Performance Issues:**
- Check vector store initialization: verify `data/vector_store/` exists
- Enable debug logging: set `PYTHONPATH` and run with `-v` flag

The system includes comprehensive logging and error reporting to help diagnose issues quickly. Check application logs for detailed troubleshooting information.

## 9. Limitations and Future Improvements

### 9.1 Current System Limitations

While comprehensive, the current implementation has some important limitations:

**Technical Limitations:**
- **No REST API**: The system uses Flask forms instead of REST endpoints
- **Single-threaded**: No concurrent request handling implemented
- **SQLite-only**: Limited to SQLite databases (no PostgreSQL, MySQL support)
- **File size limits**: 50MB maximum for uploaded files
- **No caching**: Repeated queries are processed each time

**Production Considerations:**
- **MLflow model registration**: Must run `register_model.py` before application startup
- **API costs**: Each query consumes OpenAI API credits
- **Context checking limitations**: Strict relevance checking may reject valid questions
- **Local deployment focus**: Optimized for local development, MLflow tracking server is auto-managed

### 9.2 Possible Enhancements

**High Impact Improvements:**
- **REST API Implementation**: Add proper REST endpoints for programmatic access
- **Database Support**: Extend beyond SQLite to PostgreSQL, MySQL
